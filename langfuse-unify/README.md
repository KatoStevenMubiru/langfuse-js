### Key Components

Environment Variables (.env)

Securely stores API keys and URLs.
Langfuse Client (src/clients/langfuseClient.js)

Configures and initializes the Langfuse client.
UnifyLangfuse Client (src/clients/unifyLangfuseClient.js)

Manages API calls to UnifyAI and logs interactions using Langfuse.
Usage

Set up your environment variables in .env, then run the application using:

bash
Copy code
```npm start
```
This setup provides a solid foundation for robust API interaction logging and tracing with UnifyAI and Langfuse. Adjust configurations as needed for your specific environment.
